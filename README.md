**Do not** commit in the Main branch, only commit new features in the feature branch.

The main branch will be merged with the beta branch _every day_ at 10:00 PM.
The feature branch can be commited at any time and can be merged with the beta branch once the features are thought to be stable.

Branches:
---------
  - **MAIN**, this is the stable/release branch. New releases are released from this branch every 2 days. 
  - **BETA**, this is the beta branch, every feature commited here will be pushed to the main branch _every day_ at `10 PM` everyday
  - **FEATURE**, this is the testing branch, features are supposed to be tested here and made stable to be joined in the beta branch, for which the features are made sure to be completely stable.
