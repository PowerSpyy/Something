**Do not** commit in the Main branch, only commit in the feature branch.

The main branch will be merged with the feature branch _every day_ at 10:00 PM.
The feature branch can be commited at any time.

Branches:
---------
  - **MAIN**, this is the stable branch.
  - **FEATURE**, this is the beta branch, features are supposed to be tested here and made stable to be joined in the main branch.
